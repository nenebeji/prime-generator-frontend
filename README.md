# Prime Generator Frontend
This repository contains the frontend client for the Prime Number Generator application. This React application provides a user interface to input an integer limit (N > 1) and receive a list of all prime numbers up to that limit via an API call to a separate backend service.
The UI is built using React and styled with react-bootstrap.

## Features
* User Input: A responsive form for entering the upper limit for prime generation.
* API Integration: Communicates with the backend API at `http://localhost:8080/primes/{num}`.
* Results Display: Presents the generated prime numbers in a clean, scrollable list.
* Loading and Error Handling: Provides user feedback during API requests and displays relevant error messages.
* Styling: Uses react-bootstrap components for a modern, mobile-friendly interface.

## Prerequisites
To run this application locally, you will need:
* Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
* The corresponding [Prime Generator Backend service](https://github.com/nenebeji/prime-generator-backend/tree/main) must be running locally on port 8080.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
